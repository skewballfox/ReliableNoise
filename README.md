# Reliable Communication over Noisy Channel with UDP

An old assignment for Data and Communications, most recent work using C++

The goal was to transmit a text file over a simulated noisy channel. Packets may be disordered or dropped, bugs exists in the emulator which must be accounted for in client/server code
